# Film Information Viewer

## Overview
The Film Information Viewer is a web application built using Angular 17, TypeScript, and Angular Material (specifically `mat-grid`). It provides a platform to explore information about various films along with their character lists. Users can click on a character in the list to open a new tab displaying specific character details.

## Features
- **Film Information Display**: Browse through a curated collection of films with relevant details such as title, release year, producer, etc.

- **Character Details**: Clicking on a character opens a new tab displaying detailed information about that character.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is optimized for various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular 17**: A powerful JavaScript framework for building single-page client applications.
